# Road Sign Classification Flask App

This is a Flask web application that uses a TensorFlow model to classify road sign images. The app expects cropped images that contain only the road sign, and it will return the predicted class of the road sign along with the model's confidence score.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload a cropped image of a road sign.
- **Classification**: The app classifies the road sign into one of the following categories:
  - Traffic Light
  - Stop Sign
  - Speed Limit
  - Crosswalk

- **Confidence Score**: The model provides a confidence score for its prediction.
